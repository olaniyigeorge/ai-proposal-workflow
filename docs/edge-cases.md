# Edge Cases Log

Working log of edge cases discovered while building this project — the "gotchas" that aren't obvious from `CLAUDE.md`/`docs/architecture.md`/`docs/system-flow.md`/`docs/decisions.md` alone, but shaped an implementation choice. Newest first. When an edge case changes a documented decision, update the source doc (`decisions.md`, `intake-schema.md`, etc.) too — this file explains *why*, the source docs state *what's current*.

## 2026-09-09 — Duplicate intake beyond webhook retries

**The gap:** The original idempotency key (`hash(timestamp + email_address)`, `docs/decisions.md` #4) only protects against *n8n retrying a failed delivery of the same Sheet row* — the `Timestamp` column is identical on a retry because it's the same row. It does **not** protect against a human genuinely submitting the same request twice (e.g. a salesperson re-filling the Google Form for the same client because they weren't sure the first one went through, or the client verbally re-requesting the same thing). That second submission gets a *new* `Timestamp` from Google Forms, so the old key treats it as a brand-new proposal — duplicate `Proposal` rows for what is substantively one request.

**The fix:** Idempotency key is now `hash(company_name + normalize(project_scope) + respondent_email)` — no `timestamp` in the key at all. Rationale: a true duplicate (whether a retry or a re-submission) shares these three fields; a genuinely different request from the same person on the same day will describe a different `project_scope`. `normalize()` = lowercase, trim, collapse internal whitespace, strip trailing punctuation, so a re-typed submission with cosmetic differences (extra space, re-cased text, trailing period) still dedupes.

**Where it lives:**
- Computed in FastAPI: `compute_intake_key()` / `normalize_text()` in `backend/app/services/intake_service.py`.
- n8n's Code node does **not** compute the hash — it only does Sheet-column → canonical-key translation (per the existing n8n/FastAPI boundary in `CLAUDE.md`). Keeping the hash algorithm in one place (Python) avoids a second implementation drifting from the first.
- Tests: `test_intake_idempotency_survives_resubmission_with_new_timestamp`, `test_intake_idempotency_ignores_cosmetic_differences` in `backend/tests/test_intake.py`.
- Doc updates: `docs/decisions.md` #4 (marked revised), `docs/intake-schema.md` "Idempotency key" section.

**Open follow-up:** `project_scope` is free text from a Google Form long-answer field — two submissions describing the *same* project in genuinely different wording (not just whitespace/casing) will still fork into two proposals. Current normalization only catches cosmetic differences, not semantic ones. Revisit if this turns out to happen in practice (e.g. fuzzy-match or a Claude-based dedupe check before create) — no evidence yet that it's a real problem, so not building it preemptively.

## YYYY-MM-DD — Short title

**The gap:** What broke / what wasn't handled, concretely (an input, a sequence of actions).

**The fix:** What was changed and why this approach over alternatives.

**Where it lives:** Code, tests, and doc locations touched.

**Open follow-up:** Anything still not handled, so it doesn't get silently forgotten.
